- Data Analysis: Once the data is preprocessed, we conduct thorough analysis to uncover insights. This includes exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and visualization of key trends.
- Insights and Findings: We document the insights and findings derived from the analysis, highlighting interesting patterns, correlations, and observations.
